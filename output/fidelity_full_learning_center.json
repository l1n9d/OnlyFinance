    "content": "If this year’s market volatility has got you second-guessing your investing strategy, you're not alone. It’s hard to feel certain about your investments when the economy feels so uncertain and when the market’s drop of almost 20% earlier this year is still fresh on investors’ minds. With no shortage of worrying news headlines, many investors may be wondering if they ought to change up their portfolios or even sell out of stocks in an attempt to head off any further volatility. But history shows that getting or staying out of the market has often led to weaker returns for investors. In fact, some investors may be so worried about what they can't control—like whether the market will go up or down in the next year—that they overlook the things they can control, like managing taxes on their investments and avoiding emotional decision-making. Read on for 7 top mistakes that investors are making now, and how to avoid them yourself. Sign up for Fidelity Viewpoints weekly email for our latest insights. Subscribe now 1. Avoiding investment decisions due to uncertainty Where will tariff rates finally settle? Is the economy slowing? Could high inflation come back? There’s no shortage of questions to keep investors up at night right now—and keep them second-guessing whether it’s the right time to invest. Naveen Malwal, institutional portfolio manager with Strategic Advisers, LLC, the investment manager for many of Fidelity’s managed accounts, says he sees many investors staying out of the market in the hopes that the landscape will look less uncertain at some future time. “In most environments there are a few factors that may give investors pause,” says Malwal. “Last year it was the election, and this year it might be tariffs or the latest job numbers.” The trouble with waiting for greater certainty is that it can leave investors waiting a long time—sitting on the sidelines while the market is potentially still rising. “Some investors want to see a lot of positive news headlines and flashing green lights before they jump into the market, and in my experience, it is exceedingly rare to find that,” says Malwal. Markets have historically tended to rise over the long term, usually amid continued uncertainty. 2. Always expecting the “next shoe to drop” In a similar vein, some investors may be sitting out of the market due to fear that a major market decline or economic recession may be right around the corner. “Distressing headlines can lead investors to assume the worst,” says Malwal. Headlines do occasionally spark short-term market volatility. But often the bigger risk is that by over-focusing on the negatives, investors end up missing out on opportunities and long-term growth. “Those investors may find themselves falling behind, because worries kept them out of a relatively good environment,” he says. “Relatively good” might be an apt description for the current economic environment . US companies generally experienced better-than-expected earnings growth in the second quarter, and analysts expect S&P 500 companies to earn 10% more in 2025 than they did last year. 1 Even after recent revisions to job numbers, the job market has been continuing to grow. And unemployment has remained low and relatively stable. “With rising earnings and a steady job market, recession doesn't feel imminent to me,” says Malwal. Even if the US does eventually encounter a recession, it’s typically no reason to abandon a well-thought-out investment plan. Over long periods the market has historically recovered from recessions and even a depression—often beginning to rally before the economic downturn is even over. Past performance is no guarantee of future results. Source: FMRCo, Bloomberg, Haver Analytics, FactSet. Data as of July 31, 2025.

    "title": "5 tips for new investors",
    "content": "Investing can seem intimidating if you haven't done it before, but there are great resources for beginners to get started. Here at Fidelity, we have many articles, videos, and tools to jumpstart you on your journey. Before you dive in, here are 5 helpful tips. 1. Make sure you're on solid ground financially Before you start investing, build a solid financial foundation. We suggest that you should have some emergency savings before you start investing elsewhere. Start by setting aside $1,000. Then aim to save 3 to 6 months’ worth of essential monthly expenses. Also, make sure you have paid off any high-interest debt such as credit card bills. It could be wise to take advantage of all employer matching programs for contributions to accounts like your 401(k) or HSA too. 2. Determine your goals Setting goals will give your investing a purpose and provide a finish line for your hard work. To determine your goals, spend some time figuring out what's important to you. A goal can include everything from paying your monthly bills to buying a new car or home, or even saving more for retirement. We suggest physically writing your goals down, and placing them somewhere you regularly see, so that you're reminded of what you're working toward. Once you have your goals, try to determine the cost and timeline of each of those goals. Based on that information and your risk tolerance, you can come up with an investment strategy for each individual goal. For more resources on setting goals and keeping track of progress, visit the Fidelity Goal Booster SM . Feed your brain. Fund your future. Subscribe now 3. Learn the basics When you first begin, investing can seem like a new language. There's a lot to learn when it comes to securities and financial markets—but don't be intimidated. Remember that many investors started from where you are now. And people start in many different ways, from buying stocks and bonds, to contributing to a 401(k). We suggest beginning with the basics and then working toward the more complicated topics. For example, it could be a good idea to learn the differences between stocks , mutual funds , and ETFs before diving into more complex topics such as asset allocation, diversification, and risk tolerance. Listen to podcasts (such as Money Unscripted ) and read books about investing. In the Fidelity Learning Center , we have educational content that explains the basics of investing. The more you know and understand about investing and financial markets, the better suited you can be to make educated investing decisions. 4. Don't worry if you're starting small Regardless of the amount you're investing, putting your money in a position where it has growth potential may not only increase your wealth, but also help establish financial habits that can benefit you throughout your life. Plus, investing small amounts frequently can really add up over time. Mutual funds and ETFs can provide diversification, even when investing small amounts. And with fractional shares, you can invest in companies or ETFs based on how much you want to invest, not necessarily based on their share prices. 5. Don't be afraid to ask for help With investing comes important decisions that may seem beyond your expertise. Don't be afraid to ask for help. Many investors use managed accounts to help with defining goals, understanding their current situation, and identifying key steps to move forward. Think of it as adding someone to your team. Robo advisors , such as Fidelity Go ® , could provide a way to tap into the benefits of professional money management.",

Deciding what’s right for you depends on your needs and time horizon. Missed an event on your favorite topic? Watch anytime here. You could lose money by investing in a money market fund. An investment in a money market fund is not a bank account and is not insured or guaranteed by the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation or any other government agency. Before investing, always read a money market fund’s prospectus for policies specific to that fund. Any fixed income security sold or redeemed prior to maturity may be subject to a substantial gain or loss. Your ability to sell a CD on the secondary market is subject to market conditions. If your CD has a step rate, the interest rate may be higher or lower than prevailing market rates. The initial rate on a step-rate CD is not the yield to maturity. If your CD has a call provision, which many step-rate CDs do, the decision to call the CD is at the issuer's sole discretion. Also, if the issuer calls the CD, you may obtain a less favorable interest rate upon reinvestment of your funds. Fidelity makes no judgment as to the creditworthiness of the issuing institution. In general, the bond market is volatile, and fixed income securities carry interest rate risk. (As interest rates rise, bond prices usually fall, and vice versa. This effect is usually more pronounced for longer-term securities.) Fixed income securities also carry inflation risk, liquidity risk, call risk, and credit and default risks for both issuers and counterparties. Unlike individual bonds, most bond funds do not have a maturity date, so holding them until maturity to avoid losses caused by price volatility is not possible.

Foreign securities are subject to interest rate, currency exchange rate, economic, and political risks, all of which are magnified in emerging markets. ETPs that target a small universe of securities, such as a specific region or market sector, are generally subject to greater market volatility, as well as to the specific risks associated with that sector, region, or other focus. ETPs that use derivatives, leverage, or complex investment strategies are subject to additional risks. The return of an index ETP is usually different from that of the index it tracks because of fees, expenses, and tracking error. An ETP may trade at a premium or discount to its net asset value (NAV) (or indicative value in the case of exchange-traded notes). The degree of liquidity can vary significantly from one ETP to another and losses may be magnified if no liquid market exists for the ETP's shares when attempting to sell them.

    "title": "What is NAV?",
    "content": "When you buy shares of a mutual fund or exchange-traded fund (ETF) , the fund pools your money from other investors. It’s not always easy to understand details about a mutual fund’s underlying investments because of the monthly holdings reporting requirements, vs. an ETF, which reports its holdings daily. The net asset value (NAV) calculation, which is the result of the many different investments by the fund, can help you understand the market value of the fund holdings and potentially guide your investing decisions. Feed your brain. Fund your future. Subscribe now What is NAV? Net asset value (NAV) shows the fair market value of a mutual fund or ETF based on its holdings. If you buy a stock , you can see its market price per share on its stock ticker. To determine the market value for that investment, multiply your total shares by the market price. However, a mutual fund or ETF might invest in hundreds of different stocks, bonds , and other securities, all at various prices and amounts. NAV calculates the total value of everything a fund owns minus its liabilities, divided by the number of outstanding shares. For mutual funds, that shows what investors pay per share based on the underlying investments. However, since you can trade ETFs throughout the day, their NAV will fluctuate based on market activity. How does NAV work? The NAV calculation tallies up everything a fund owns for investments and cash, then subtracts everything it owes for debts and other liabilities, and divides that by the number of outstanding shares. The net result shows the fair market value of the fund’s holdings. NAV could change daily based on market performance and decisions the fund manager makes regarding assets and liabilities. The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) requires mutual funds and ETFs to calculate NAV daily at a minimum. Mutual funds usually calculate their NAV at the end of stock market trading hours . This gives investors a quick insight into the value of the fund holdings and sets the price for buying or selling shares. Most mutual funds trade based on the NAV at the end of each business day. Why is NAV important? NAV is important because it conveys a lot of information about a fund’s holdings in a single number. Without it, if an investor wanted to know the value of all the fund’s holdings, they’d have to do the math based on how the portfolio is allocated—a lengthy and complex calculation. NAV is also important because it can be used to track a fund’s performance over time, and it can help investors find buying and selling opportunities, especially for ETFs. ETFs change prices and trade throughout the day, like stocks. The market price might end up drifting away from the NAV of the underlying investments. This could be an opportunity for an investor to buy certain funds at a discount or to sell at a profit against the NAV. Additionally, certain big financial firms, called authorized participants or APs, can create or remove ETF shares to help keep the ETF’s price close to the value of the investments it holds and aligned with their NAV. NAV formula The NAV formula is as follows: A fund’s assets ‒ liabilities/total outstanding shares = net asset value (NAV) NAV formula example Here’s an example of how to calculate NAV. Let’s say a mutual fund has $200 million in securities based on the market value of its holdings at the end of a trading day. It also has $5 million in cash and has earned another $250,000 from its investments’ performance that day. As for liabilities, the mutual fund has $15 million in short-term debt and $7 million in long-term. It also spent $50,000 that day. The fund has 10 million outstanding shares. To get the NAV, first total up its assets. $200 million + $5 million + $250,000 = $205,250,000 (total assets) Then add up its liabilities. $15 million + $7 million + $50,000 = $22,050,000 (total liabilities) Next, subtract total liabilities from total assets. $205,250,000 (total assets) – $22,050,000 (total li",

    "content": "Between researching investments, monitoring the markets, and managing your portfolio, investing might sound like a full-time job. Enter the robo advisor: a simple and relatively inexpensive way to get help building an investment strategy and putting it into action. What is a robo advisor? A robo advisor is an affordable digital financial service that uses technology to help automate investing, based on information investors provide about themselves including their risk tolerance and financial situation. No, it's not an actual robot advisor and, yes, there are still humans involved. \"Robo\" refers to these services being almost completely digital. \"Advisor\" covers all the human advisors behind the scenes who offer digital investment advice and account management services for investors. Thanks to automation, robo advisory services are often offered for a lower fee than traditional investment management. Feed your brain. Fund your future. Subscribe now How do robo advisors work? Most robo advisors use different pieces of information about an investor to suggest an investment strategy, then create and maintain a portfolio that aligns with that strategy. In most cases, you'll first be asked some questions—online or through an app—about yourself, your current financial situation, and your goals, or what you're investing for and when you need the money. You'll also be asked about your tolerance for investment risk, or how comfortable you are with market ups and downs. A robo advisor uses that information to suggest a mix of different types of investments to help support your goals and objectives. After that, it keeps an eye on things for you and typically rebalances your account by automatically buying and selling investments to help keep you on track over time. What is a hybrid robo advisor? While a robo advisor account is managed mostly online or through an app, a hybrid robo advisor is a service that typically combines a robo advisor with live, personalized financial coaching. This means you'll have a chance to ask questions, exchange ideas, and discuss your goals with a real person. For many hybrid robo advisors these conversations happen by phone rather than in-person. By meeting over the phone, these services can come at a lower cost than meeting in person with a traditional financial advisor. Still, a hybrid robo advisor might cost more than a robo advisor alone. Fidelity's robo advisor, Fidelity Go ® , offers hybrid robo advisory services for a fee of 0.35% a year for those with balances of $25,000 or more. How much does a robo advisor cost? It depends. Typically, robo advisors will charge what's called an advisory fee, which is usually a percentage of the money you have invested. Again, robo advisors generally have a much lower advisory fee than a traditional managed option because they cost less to operate. Minimum investments can be kept low too, potentially making robo advisors a good option for beginners. ( Fidelity Go charges no advisory fees on account balances less than $25,000 and requires no minimum to open an account and only $10 to start investing). Depending on the investments in your managed portfolio, you may pay additional management fees on certain investments—such as mutual funds and ETFs—in addition to your robo advisory fees, which can add to the total amount you pay. That's why you should research different robo advisors to see what types of investments they offer and whether those come with any additional fees. Fidelity Go, for example, uses a combination of mutual funds that don't charge management fees. Can a robo advisor help manage the risk that comes with investing? All investing involves risk and the potential to lose money due to market fluctuations that happen over time. A robo advisor can help manage some of that risk in 3 ways: First, it helps strengthen your portfolio through diversification, which means spreading your money around to different investments to potentially reduce your risk of los",

    "title": "When is open enrollment for 2025?",
    "content": "Need to find, change, or cancel your health insurance? The open enrollment period is the time to do it. So when is open enrollment? It depends on how you get your health insurance. Here’s when enrollment periods run for different government health insurance programs, plus when you’re likely to be able to enroll in employer-sponsored plans. Feed your brain. Fund your future. Subscribe now What is open enrollment? Open enrollment is the time of year when people may review, select, or modify their health insurance coverage. Usually lasting for a few weeks in the fall, this tends to be the only period when anyone can enroll in or make changes to their health insurance coverage (unless there is a special exception). Both employers and the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace have open enrollment periods for people to enroll in health insurance and other benefits, if applicable. When is open enrollment for Healthcare.gov? Open enrollment for health insurance coverage starting in 2026 through Healthcare.gov—aka the ACA Health Insurance Marketplace—runs from November 1, 2025 through January 15, 2026, for residents of most states. If you complete your application by December 15, 2025 and pay your first premium, your coverage begins January 1, 2026. Some states and districts use their own state-based marketplaces independent of the federal platform. Some of their open enrollment periods coincide with Healthcare.gov’s; some are slightly different. (Keep reading for those open enrollment dates.) When is open enrollment if you get health insurance through your employer? Open enrollment for health insurance coverage and other employer-sponsored insurance plans (such as vision, dental, and life) typically runs for 2 to 4 weeks, often (but not always) in October or November. Your benefits or human resources department should notify you in advance of this period. When is the Annual Enrollment Period for Medicare? The Annual Enrollment Period for Medicare is October 15 to December 7 each year, but that period is for people who have previously enrolled in Medicare. When you first become eligible for Medicare, generally in the month you turn age 65, you’re supposed to enroll during your Initial Enrollment Period (IEP), which begins 3 months before your 65th birthday month and lasts until 3 months after your birthday month. If you are born on the first of the month, your initial enrollment period begins 4 months before the month you turn age 65 and concludes 2 months after it, with coverage taking effect as early as the month before you turn age 65. If you miss your IEP window, you may have to apply during the General Enrollment Period, which lasts from January 1 to March 31 every year. Waiting for this period could come with lifetime late enrollment penalties that may be added to your premiums for as long as you are enrolled in Medicare, unless there are qualifying extenuating circumstances that waive the fee. When is open enrollment for Medicaid? There isn’t a specific open enrollment period for Medicaid. Eligible individuals can currently apply any time of year. What types of government insurance don’t use open enrollment? Medicaid, which typically provides insurance to lower income individuals, families, and other mandatory eligibility groups, and the Children’s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), which provides low-cost coverage for kids and pregnant women whose families are above Medicaid’s income threshold, don’t use open enrollment. These joint federal-and-state insurance programs use the federal poverty levels as a guideline for determining state income thresholds. Since anyone’s income can drop any time of year, enrollment to Medicaid and CHIP is rolling. Open enrollment dates Open enrollment deadlines for state-based marketplace insurance can vary slightly from state to state, but within each state, the dates tend to stay consistent from year to year. If you don’t see your state in this chart, it’s because its residents can sign up for health ",
